Vertical Pipette-View Camera Holder
=================================

This vertical camera holder is for capturing footage
of the deck from the pipette's view on the gantry. The
camera holder bottom holds an ELP USB camera PCB

(fits most 38x38) PCBs. The camera holder top snaps
into the bottom, and the two together form a case that
can be mounted to the bottom of the pipette gantry
on the flat end of the 2020 bar.

Directions:
Slide the camera PCB onto the camera holder bottom.
Snap the camera holder top into the camera holder
bottom such that all holes align with the pegs on
the bottom piece. Insert a screw through the mounting
hole on the bottom of the case such that threading
faces inward. Loosely attach a T-nut and slide the
assembly up into the bottom end of the 2020 bar that
the pipette is mounted on such that the screw is at
the back side of the assembly. The center peg should
fit into the center hole of the bar. Tighten the screw
to fix it in position.
