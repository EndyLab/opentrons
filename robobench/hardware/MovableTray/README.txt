Movable Tray
=============

The movable tray is used for moving labware. It is
designed to be attached to the 8-Channel Adapter in
a completed assembly. The snap fit pegs on each
leg of the adapter will snap into the adapter holes on
the tray. The adapter works by acting as a row of p200
tips, allowing the entire assembly to be lifted and
moved by the multichannel pipette.

Directions:
Snap the adapter into the movable tray or other movable
hardware piece you may have designed. If there is any
wiggle in the assembly due to your 3D Printer
resolution, add super glue around the snap fits to 
secure the adapter to the movable hardware. Once the
glue is dry, insert p200 pipette tips into each of the
holes in the adapter -- the adapter will work without
these, but the pipette tips allow the adapter to form
a much tighter grip with the pipette. Once the tips are
in place, use a hot glue gun to place hot glue
liberally around the tips where they exit the bottom
of the adapter; this will fix them in place. Once the
hot glue is dry, the assembly can be used.

Movable Tray note:
To use the completed assembly with the movable tray,
slide in a 96-well plate or one of the acryllic tube
racks that came with your Opentrons robot. When using
an acryllic tube rack, you may want to super glue the
edges of the tube rack to the edges of the adapter.

When using with a 96-well plate the assembly will sit
normally in a grid slot. When using with a tube rack
you should sit the assembly atop the pegs of the bottom
piece of an Opentrons tube rack without screwing the
assembly into the pegs. This will allow it to be lifted
off of the pegs for movement.
