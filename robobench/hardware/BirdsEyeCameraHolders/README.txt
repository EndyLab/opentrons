==============
The camera holder bottom holds an ELP USB camera

(fits most 38x38 PCBs). The camera holder top
snaps into the bottom, and the two together form
a slider mount that will allow you to mount the
encased cammera on a bar of 2020 for a variety of
applications. This can be used anywhere on the
robot, and is especially useful for cv applications.


Directions:
Slide the camera PCB onto the camera holder bottom.
Snap the camera holder top into the camera holder
bottom such that all holes align with the pegs on
the bottom piece. Slide the assembled case and
camera into the T-slot of a bar of 2020. For easy
disassembly, use your fingernail to pry the case
open at the side with the 2020 slider mount.

NOTE: Print on its side with sufficient support
material to avoid creating fragile pegs that will
break easily.
