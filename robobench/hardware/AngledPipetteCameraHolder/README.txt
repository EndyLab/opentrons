Angled Pipette-View Camera Holder
=================================

This angled camera holder is for capturing footage
of the pipette on the gantry. The camera holder bottom
holds an ELP USB camera PCB

(fits most 38x38) PCBs. The camera holder top snaps
into the bottom, and the two together form an angled
case that can be mounted to the gantry behind a
pipette using a slide-in T-nut and screw.

Directions:
Slide the camera PCB onto the camera holder bottom.
Snap the camera holder top into the camera holder
bottom such that all holes align with the pegs on
the bottom piece. Insert a screw through the mounting
hole on the case such that threading faces outward.
Loosely attach a T-nut and slide the assembly onto the
back-side of the pipette gantry from the bottom up.
Tighten the screw to fix it in position.
