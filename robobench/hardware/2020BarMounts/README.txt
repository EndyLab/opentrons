2020 Mount
==========

These clips attach to the upper, rounded 3030 bar
of the OT-One, allowing you to mount a bar of 2020
over the top of the robot. We use this to mount
the camera holder (see hardware folder) for cv
applications.

Directions: 
Print two clips on their sides such that
they don't break when bent. Clip them to the
rounded bar such that the 2020 slider mount is
level and each clip is directly across from the
other. If you are mounting a camera to the bar,
slide the camera mount onto the 2020 first before
mounting it onto the clips. The bar should sit
just above the gantry such that the two do not
collide.

Note:
There are 3 versions available, each made for
different brands of 2020 bar. The OT version fits
the bars used by Opentrons (if you happen to have
any extra). Typically users have to purchase extra
2020 bar to complete this setup -- the Amazon version
fits 2020 bar ordered from 80/20 Inc. via Amazon,
while the McMaster version fits 2020 bar ordered
from McMaster Carr.
