Eppendorf Research Pipette Holder
=================================

These clips attach any Eppendorf Research Pippete
(common but now discontinued) to the gantry.
Files for clips labeled with an "E" (to avoid
confusion with other clips) or unlabeled are
available. The tight fit of these clips reduces
error due to movement and helps to hold pipette
calibration as more are used.

Directions:
Print 2 to 4 clips and use them to attach the
Eppendorf Research Pipette to the pipette axis by
sliding them onto the middle of the pipette (under
the number display, usually where the sticker or
barcode is attached). Four clips guarantees a very
strong hold, but two should work fine.
