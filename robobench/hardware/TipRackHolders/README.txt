FisherBrand Tip Rack Holder
============================

This tip rack holder snaps into the grid of the
robot and holds any size FisherBrand Pipette Tip
Rack steady in the grid slot to reduce error due
to movement of the tip rack and hold calibration.

Directions:
Slide the tip rack holder into any grid slot. Snap
in your tip rack box in the correct orientation
(note one side is different from the other).

NOTE: Some tip rack boxes may be warped, leading
to difficulty or an improper fit when inserting
them into the holder.
